## Installation

To start, please take the ".env.EXAMPLE" file and add in the requried info. Then, delete the ".EXAMPLE" portion of the file. This will allow the application to access your SQL database.

Next, run "npm i" in the terminal to install the required packages. After the packages are installed type "npm resetdb" in order to setup the database. Then you can go ahead and type "npm run seed" After the seed file has been run you can run "node server.js" to access the CRUD functionalities in localhost:3001 through Insomnia. As there is no front-end in this application you will need to install Insomnia as well. For a more in depth walkthrough please refer to the video guide posted towards the top of this README.
